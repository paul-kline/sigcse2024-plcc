Workshop Exercise #3
====================

Run 'plccmk prefix.plcc' after you complete each of the steps below. You
can test your interpreter by running the read-eval-print loop 'rep',
entering prefix expressions at the keyboard or from a file.

1. Complete the semantic section of the 'prefix.plcc' specification
file so that prefix expressions of the binary operators "-", "*",
and "/" defined in the 'Sub', 'Mul', and 'Div' classes get evaluated
correctly. Model your solutions by examining the implementation of the
"+" operator in the 'Add' class.

Observe, for example, that the prefix expression

    - 5 3

evalutes to 2, not -2, so order is important.

Test your solution to this step as follows:

    rep < testprog1.txt

Examine the contents of the test file to see if your results are
correct.

2. Add a new operator for unary negation: "_". Augment all three
sections of the PLCC prefix.plcc specification file to account for it.

Test your solution to this step as follows:

    rep < testprog2.txt

Notes
=====

This exercise illustrates (A) how the parse tree node classes have
available to them their child nodes (as fields in the LHS class)
for semantic analyis, and (B) how subclass names are used in PLCC to
distinguish among multiple BNF rules having the same LHS nonterminal.

Question: Without making any other changes to your language specification
file, could you use the SUB token "-" as the prefix operator for unary
negation instead of "_"?  Explain your answer.

Question: Without making any other changes to your language specification
file, can you change the lexical specification for the INTEGER token so
signed decimal integers will be recognized? If so, -9 will be considered
as a single token, and the expression "--9 4" evaluates to -13, while
the expression "- 9 4" evaluates to 5.

Question: Without making any other changes to your language specification
file, can you use the digraph "--" as the prefix operator for unary
negation? If so, what would be the value of the expression "--- 2 7"?
